With Azure Boards => create work item (unique ID), work item types => user epics | features | stories | tasks | bugs (as Agile process provides)
                    epics    - significant business initiatives
                    features - set of work
                    user stories - work that assign to specific team members
                    tasks    - even smaller amounts of work for which you want to track time either in hours or days
                    bugs     - defects

Works progresses => Status of work item => New | Active | Resolved | Closed

Kanban Boards (New, Active, Resolved, and Closed)
    Collaborate (Discussion-tagging, dashboards-status, notifications-status change, follow specific issues)

Scrum sprints   
    Plan work to current or future sprints
    Forecast work that can get completed based on effort estimates
    Determine how much work can be done within a sprint
    Bulk assign issues and tasks to team members in sprints

    Work --- Organize work into a hierarchy         
            Epic 
             -> Features (Product Backlog Item + User Story + Task)
               -----------------------------------------------------
               |                                                   |
               |  -> Sprint Iteration =>                           |
               |      -> User Story                                |
               |          -> Task (+ Bug Configurable)             |
               |                                                   |
               -----------------------------------------------------

Tool for the job
Boards  : visual view + flow => work items as cards similar to sticky notes. i.e. -> associated project & team
          Kanban board => (Stories, Features, and Epics) => track requirements & sprint-independent
          Sprint Taskboard => sprint associated -> tracking tasks defined -> monitor progress (capacity charts | burndown chart)



Backlogs: work items as lists i.e. represents project plan + future work + information for team | organize as prioritity + hierarchy
          Roadmap 4 plans to deliver | organize i.e. prioritity + hierarchy list of features & requirements
          Organize, Assign, Track Work | team always knows what next
          (bugs : Scrum default => bugs along with product backlog.)
          Ideas into backlog or stories
          priority order | details and estimates
        
            Effort Story Points : For user stories and requirements capture estimates in Story Points and Size
                                  Agile methods recommend set estimates based on relative size of work
                                  Fibonacci sequence i.e. powers of 2 (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) 

            Business Value      : captures priority value for Product Backlog Item(PBI) relatively compared to other PBIs
                                  higher the number, the greater the business value


Implement Scrum   : Define Sprint => Plan Sprint => Monitor Sprint progress => Forcast for future.

Sprints:  
          Choose backlog wogitrk item to an iteration
          Team builds sprint backlog during sprint planning meeting, typically first day of sprint
          Each sprint corresponds to a time-boxed interval
          During the planning meeting, product owner works with team to identify stories/backlog to complete in sprint

          Taskboards            : Filtered view of work item assigned in specific iteration (stories, tasks, +bugs)
                                  
          Set sprint capacity   : Determine team's actual capacity | capacity correlates to actual task time
                                  Takes into consideration work hours by team members + non-working days
                                  Days/time available for each member can vary from sprint to sprint
                
                                        Set capacity for sprint 
                                        Copy capacity from previous sprint 
                                        Track capacity when performing multiple activities
                                        Add or remove user accounts from capacity planning
                                        Track capacity when working on more than one team

          Team velocity chart   : help to determine work capacity from sprint-over-sprint
                                  chart only available for backlog and based on sum of estimates made to Effort

          Forecast Tool         : Once team completed 1 or 2 sprint, team-specific, team ability
                                  Forecast tool to help in their sprint planning. using values of team velocity
                                  Forecast tool will show which items in backlog can be completed within future sprint
